# Juz 1

## Surah baqarah

### Summary

- verses 1-10: the believers are those who believe in the unseen, establish prayer, and donate their wealth. The disbelievers have a sickness in their heart, like they are blindfolded from seeing the truth. 
- verses 11-30: Allah gives proof as this book is unable to be replicated, It is a linguistic miracle. Allah also refers to his use of parables as a test for those disbelievers, as they will waste time arguing, "what does Allah mean by such a parable?" when they're entirely missing the point. In 
	- In verse 30, the angels ask God why he's creating humanity when they are evil. But he puts us there for a reason only he knows.
	>O humanity! Worship your Lord, Who created you and those before you, so that you may become mindful ˹of Him˺
	>
	>And if you are in doubt about what We have revealed to Our servant, then produce a sûrah like it and call your helpers other than Allah, if what you say is true.
