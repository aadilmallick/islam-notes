When learning the sunnah, it is important to understand that knowledge is nothing without applying it. 

> The pious predecessors defined knowledge as, “Fear that would engrave more acts of worship in a person’s heart, increase good habits and make the person more eager to apply them.”

> A person once said to another who often sought knowledge but did not practice what he learnt, “You wasted your life in collecting weapons, so, when will you fight?”

> Many people are eager, obedient and ravenous to seek knowledge, yet, they neither benefit themselves nor benefit others from it.

Many people are ravenous to learn hadith, but they never apply it. **Knowledge requires practicing it**.

The sunnah is optional, but recommended. You will not be punished for not following it.

## Best quotes

> “The example of the one who remembers his Lord (God) in comparison with the one who does not remember his Lord is that of the living and the dead.”

## Duas

### How to make duas

Always start duas by praising Allah and then sending peace and blessings to the prophet. When asking Allah for something specific, refer to him by one of his 99 names the closest to what you are asking for, like the Ever-forgiving.

- When washing your hands, wash the in-betweens of your fingers
