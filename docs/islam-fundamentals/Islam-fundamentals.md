# Fundamentals of islam

## Basic principles of islam

Religion has a clear purpose for humanity: to achieve nearness to God and serving your fellow human being.
- Islam literally means “obedience and peace”. Your duty is complete submission to God and to be at peace with all creatures of God.

- According to Islam, no event occurs in this Universe without God’s knowledge and implicit consent. He is the ultimate source of every action and happening, animate or inanimate.
- Every person is born innocent and free from sin
- Once you have reached a mature age, you become responsible for your sins.
- God always sends warnings and knowledge to give you a chance to avoid his punishment
- Faith is not meaningful if followed blindly. You have to reason why you want to believe in God and follow his teachings.

## Fate

Allah lets humans have free will over their actions. He does not interfere unless he desires to. Man has control over his own destiny, but not so much for his fate.

_Divine decree_, also known as fate, comes in two types:

- **suspended:** You may avoid this bad fate by praying and alms-giving
- **absolute:** You cannot avoid this bad fate, but Allah will give you rewards in return

## Salah

A perfect salat is when the worshipper’s focus reaches such a climax that they feel as if they were seeing Allah

The purpose of salat has three purposes:
- connected to God
- purify inner self
- Seek help in difficulties of life

### Ethics

Acts of worship without service to humanity are not acceptable to Allah. We must serve humanity during our short time here on earth

> One who does not show mercy to people will not be shown mercy to Allah

The prophet always spoke the truth. A Muslim always speaks the truth even if it goes against his own interests or the interests of his relatives or friends.

So, in summary:

- Serve humanity
- Forgive others
- Tell the truth
- Obey your parents
